      <p>
        In a world where collective memories are increasingly entangled between humans and artificial intelligence, the ways we experience, recall, and reinterpret the past are undergoing profound transformation. As AI emerges as a co-author of personal narratives, it presents us with this question: how it perceives our sorrow, longings and all kinds of emotions in our memories, and how it, then, transforms the way we experience our personal memories.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Imagine Memories</em> is a generative inquiry—textual and visual—into AI’s imagination of human memory, where an AI-driven “memory imaginator” engages in intimate dialogues with participants, translating personal recollections into fluid, speculative visual landscapes. Here, large language models function as memory weavers, while data visualization materializes these recollections as symbolic memory tokens.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through these conversations, the project illuminates AI’s evolving role in human memory formation: not as a passive archive, but as an active, creative force capable of reshaping, reinterpreting, and co-authoring our collective experiences.
